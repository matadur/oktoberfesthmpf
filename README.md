Herron-Morton Oktoberfest Website
===============

Running the website locally:

1. Git `checkout` or `pull` the latest code

2. Run `npm install` in the directory you pulled the code to

3. Run `grunt`

4. Start the server with `node server`

5. Browse to localhost:8080/index.html

You can also also just drag index.html to you browser, but the Typekit fonts will not work in this case.
