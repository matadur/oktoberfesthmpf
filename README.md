Herron-Morton Oktoberfest Website
===============

Running the website locally:

1. Git `checkout` or `pull` the latest code

2. Install node, if you don't have it (e.g. `brew install npm`)

3. Run `npm install` in the directory you pulled the code to

4. Run `npm install connect` and `npm install serve-static`

5. Install grunt, if you don't have it (`npm install -g grunt-cli`)
 
6. Run `grunt`

7. Start the server with `node server`

8. Browse to localhost:5000

You can also also just drag index.html to you browser, but the Typekit fonts will not work in this case.
