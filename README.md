Herron-Morton Oktoberfest Website
===============

Running the website locally:

1. Git `checkout` or `pull` the latest code

2. Install node, if you don`t have it (e.g. brew install npm)

3. Run `npm install` in the directory you pulled the code to

4. Run `npm install connect` and `npm install serve-static`

5. Install grunt, if you don`t have it (npm install -g grunt-cli)
 
6. Run `grunt`

7. Start the server with `node server`

8. Browse to localhost:8080/index.html

You can also also just drag index.html to you browser, but the Typekit fonts will not work in this case.
